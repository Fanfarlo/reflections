When would you want you use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When I have to save some work done and I want to share it
- When I want collaboration from people in my project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because I would like to know every time a change in my project is committed and pull it into my project
