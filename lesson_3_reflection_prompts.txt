When would you want you use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When I have to save some work done and I want to share it
- When I want collaboration from people in my project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because I would like to know every time a change in my project is committed and pull it into my project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- You use Forks when you need to copy and work with a recipe from other users
- You use Clones when you want a copy of a recipe in your computer.
- You use Branches to pull and push commits between your computer and GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- We can compare our local code with someone collaborations in GitHub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- Would be easy to merge changes
- Would be harder to compare the changes and keep track of the collaboration from every user.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Separate Branch
- To try new things in my project and wanted to keep my original version on master.
- To make a collaboration into other users projects
- To have a history of all my commits in case of a bug or conflicts.

Master Branch
- To make little changes to my project
- To easy keep track of all my changes.
