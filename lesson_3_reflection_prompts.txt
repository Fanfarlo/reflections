When would you want you use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When I have to save some work done and I want to share it
- When I want collaboration from people in my project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because I would like to know every time a change in my project is committed and pull it into my project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- You use Forks when you need to copy and work with a recipe from other users
- You use Clones when you want a copy of a recipe in your computer.
- You use Branches to pull and push commits between your computer and GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- We can compare our local code with someone collaborations in GitHub.
